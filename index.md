  <h2 class="post-title">A community of makers</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">Going back to its founding as a trading post, Buffalo is, and always has been, a community of makers, innovators, and inventors. The steam powered grain elevator, the roll top desk, the air conditioner, the first jet plane, the electric chair, the pacemaker, and, of course, the chicken wing were all invented here.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title">Why making?</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">Making is the act and process of creation and production. Invention and innovation depend on makers. We believe making connects communities and promotes self-driven life-long learning, creativity, and fulfillment.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title">Making is for students</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">Making matters. It gives students a space to explore the world in a way that rigid curriculum does not allow. It allows for failure, a necessary part of learning and an essential soft-skill that is easy to talk about and difficult to learn.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title">Making is for everyone</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">Making isn't just child's play. Real businesses can be created with real jobs and real economic impact. Even seemingly simple activities like repairing something in your home rather than throwing it out can have real community impact.</p>
