The **“Maker Movement”** refers to inventors, designers, and other self-reliant innovators who are moving technology forward with their imagination and independent work culture. From creating new business opportunities to spurring community revitalization and improving our schools, the Maker Movement can change an economic landscape—and Buffalo is poised to participate, pave the way, and realize the advantages this movement brings.

Buffalo is, and has always been, a community of makers. We want to recognize and build upon our success so that it can continue to grow. The first step is awareness. If you would like to contribute, please feel free to reach out [via email](mailto:david.a.brenner@gmail.com) or to contribute to this site through [Github](https://github.com/davidbrenner/buffalomakes.com).

The video above, produced by 43North, Buffalo Niagara Enterprise, and Paget Films, discusses where Buffalo came from and the accomplishments of our community and its members. It is meant to inspire the future possibilties. We want to realize these possibilites through encouraging the creation and promotion of makerspaces within our community.
